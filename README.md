# Segregation in a vibrated granular environment - L3 Project
The granular materials possess very rich behavior, which some are still badly understood. One of them is the capacity of a ensemble
of grains to get auto organized. We study here this sorting phenomenon in a Granular middle subject to repeated vibrations. 
The experiment consists in placing at the bottom of a bowl, a ball of important diameter then to fill the bowl with others of
smaller diameter. 
The bowl is subject to horizontal oscillations, supposed sinusoidal. During the simulations, we observe that the big ball
raised in the bowl.
